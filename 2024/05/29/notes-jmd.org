** Consensus

In science also in humanities especially in science these days.
Because sometimes it's difficult to tell the difference between
science or pseudo-science or anti-science in the end of the day, we need to
rely on Community consensus.  You discuss this
epistemically, like-minded Community generating knowledge in
natural sciences. In a way, maybe not to that extennt qw have this sort of
consensus but maybe it's not as rigorous as it is in
science. So can we say in this way, does Humanitys function more or
less the same way as science does.

On a social level, there are a lot of similarities. 
One one important factor for understanding the similarities is
The knowledge that scientific consensus doesn't really work by like
people voting or even like coming together and agreeing like this is
what we're gonna Believe, or this is what, you know we're gonna adopt. I mean, that
does happen. Um, but it's not the typical kind of Object of consensus does not arise to that status
through a explicit discussion and vote.
It's like a cultural Trend (meme), that just percolates up and,
It's not just a fad in the way that any old cultural Trend might might arise
Things only really percolate up to that level and the natural Sciences
if they satisfy. A bunch of Important criteria for scientific knowledge.
Okay, so, you know, it's not just anything, that's going to be able to rise to that level. Um,
but when it does it does so and and I think very much the same fashion,
it's highly uncoordinated, right? It's just individuals.
It's something resonating with individuals, it's Satisfying
the criteria that they, insist upon for their own work.

Moving forward with it and broadly speaking, this is how things become Exemplars, right? How things
Rise to a certain kind of Very general level of acceptance in the
humanities.
We're employing different criteria or it's like I don't care. How many decimal places You know, a a result in philosophy
or you know, an argument in  literary criticism has.
I have different criteria, you know that that I use to govern my acceptance
or my interest in a result.

But I do employ some criteria. I would assume, I inherited much of
those criteria from my training and kind of my inclusion as a member
of this discipline. It is just not an accident, when
something, Some major work say in philosophy is published and gains
very, very broad acceptance.
It has done so because it resonates so powerfully with so many different members of Um, the
community. And I mean, add it fundamentally that is what the
process of scientific consensus looks like.

**  Scientific knowledge is to science as canonical texts are to the humanities.

There's this beautiful quote in your book.  This, this sentence that I
really love :
""scientific knowledge is to science as canonical texts are to the humanities.""

Think of something like Newton's mechanics, contemporary quantum mechanics as a set of
stable set of ideas that are not for the purpose of being believed by
other scientists. But are there for the purpose of Generating New
Pathways for inquiry that the current generation of scientists will move down.
(note: this is the growing stock idea)

That to me is what scientific knowledge is, It's a stock That
Generates further inquiry.

From my perspective, this is always the way in which canonical texts
have functioned in the humanities, right?  They're not there as as A
stock of ideas to be believed and accepted into one's heart.  rather,
What they're there for is,to get Scholars to reflect on, what is
important and this Arena and Frame new inquiries On the basis of those
Reflections.

On the basis of those kind of Norms of importance are value that, that
they've inherited.  That are reflected or exemplified in those
canonical works.  There's a lot of results in in the principia that
are just not correct.  And the subsequent generations of Scholars did
not accept and knew were wrong.  But they accepted The value of
Newton's approach to the study of nature.  And, They were not going to
give that up, no matter what I mean, even if, every result that Newton
had published was wrong, That it didn't it wouldn't have mattered.

I mean, it was just such a powerfully well organized.  Well-conceived,
way to structure problems that, the specific claims that Newton makes.
And that's why we're still using it.

** Relections

I think we can reflect this into memes, he does not mention
memes directly, but he talks of the "stock" growing, this is the vine analogy,
and we can consider it to be like scombinators representing
memes in a continuation.

He talks of the memeification, so we have a disciplined group of
people with criteria for accepting knowledge.

My thoughts on broad resonance remind me of spectral decomposition.
We can think of different groups as holding values dear that resonate
with each other. Those might holder of certain meme coins or memes, or be engaged
with the certain behaviours or mimicry and the furtherance of those.

My thoughts on broad resonance also lead me to the etomology
of the word, sonos and hearning, and we can think of music
as being made of many parts or frequencies that come together in harmony
like music. this leads us back the the story of the muses, and the mnemosyne
the mother of the muses who is cultural memory and how these timeless metaphors
might resonate with the idea of conciousness itself.

We can think of the transformers paper as being one such paper that changed
how people think. See the

** ideas of conciousnesness

Nothing can trigger more discord than the idea of consiousness, the soul,
any form of self awareness, any form of idea that we think or act on our own.

These are distractions or details because we dont have to agree or go over those parts that
will not resonate with others, we can think of them as overfitting
or overspecification or over detailed
that distract from the ideas of unity.

Certainly! We can integrate the OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) into the system schema to ensure that the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), AI, and users collectively reach a consensus. Here's how we can modify the code:

```scheme
(define (ooda-loop)
  ;; Implement the OODA loop for consensus building
  (define (observe)
    ;; Observe changes and inputs from the environment
    #;... )

  (define (orient)
    ;; Orient the system based on observations and inputs
    #;... )

  (define (decide)
    ;; Decide on a course of action based on observations and orientation
    #;... )

  (define (act)
    ;; Act on the decision made, updating the system accordingly
    #;... )
  
  ;; Execute the OODA loop
  (define (execute-ooda-loop)
    (observe)
    (orient)
    (decide)
    (act))
  
  ;; Return the OODA loop execution procedure
  execute-ooda-loop)

;; Include the OODA loop in the plan execution
(define (execute-plan)
  (operating-system
    ;; Include system services and extensions
    (services
      (append
        (list (implementation-driver)
              (configuration-management)
              (testing-and-deployment)
              (community-engagement)
              (ooda-loop)) ;; Include the OODA loop
        %base-services)))) ;; Include base system services
```

With the OODA loop integrated into the system schema, the system can continuously observe changes and inputs from the environment, orient itself based on these observations, decide on a course of action, and act accordingly. This iterative process ensures that the DAO, AI, and users collectively reach a consensus and adapt to changing conditions effectively.


Certainly! Here's a formal executable plan in Guix Scheme:

```scheme
```

This plan outlines the system configuration and defines various procedures for implementing the plan, including the setup of Guix Bootstrap, self-hosted P2P Git, continuous integration with Cuirass, smart contract-driven implementation, configuration management with derivations, testing and deployment logic, and community engagement strategies. It then executes the plan to configure the system accordingly.
