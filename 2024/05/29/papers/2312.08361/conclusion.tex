\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced a novel fault-tolerant algorithm for inferencing large language models. On top of it, we introduced a decentralized system for running LLMs on distributed unreliable devices connected over the Internet, which significantly outperforms other approaches to running inference on consumer-grade hardware. We demonstrated that the proposed system can scale to the largest publicly available language model with hundreds of billions of trainable parameters.

While our work is focused on technical aspects, it is important to consider limitations of our approach, such as privacy of data processed by outside peers, as well as broader impact of making LLMs more accessible. We discuss these issues and outline directions for future work in Appendix~\ref{sect:discussion}.
