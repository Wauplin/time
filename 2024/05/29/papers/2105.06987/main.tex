\title{Scaling Ensemble Distribution Distillation to Many Classes with Proxy Targets}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

% justification to your answer}, either by referencing the appropriate section of
% your paper or providing a brief inline description.  For example:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerYes{See Section~\ref{gen_inst}.}
%   \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerNo{The code and the data are proprietary.}
%   \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerNA{}
% \end{itemize}
% Please do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your
% answers.  Note that the Checklist section does not count towards the page
% limit.  In your paper, please delete this instructions block and only keep the
