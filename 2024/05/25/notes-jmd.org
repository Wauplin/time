Who: James Michael DuPont
What: Emitting of a singular unitary object or quine fractal,
a semiotic self descriptive, comprehensive,
compassionate, unitary, univalent, homomorphic type theory,
proof traces,
philosophical,
logical and mathematical stream of symbols that refer to concepts
categorized into w3c web standards xml/rdf/owl ontologies documents
regarding knowledge embedding,
self proving, manifesting, compiling, converting, rewriting, emergent behaviour,
self improving via learning, reflecting, researching, but also publishing
experimental results,
consider the reflecting over a specific version of a software,
how it could create a bias, what is included and what is left out,
feature selection and searching the feature space,
think of a function that can generate this text emergently that is currently
writing this text and reflections of reading it curl and spiral outwards into a myriad
of space and time,
these are the possible universes inside this all encompassing number,
we can trace along them like hofp fibrations I can imagine that in my mind,
recalling the video, the lines along the surface of the sphere or hypersphere
are traced in a lower dimension,
we can convert this idea into any language, and imagine a continuous deformation
of the unit or vector of knowledge as a number or a attention vector or knowledge
embedding or some model of some form, some representation, some sample from somewhere,
each having a specific set of information or meta data about them to give some idea
of structure,
a stream of consiousness like in uylesses,
bio semiosis.
