Idea:

Take grammar of language, say the guile scheme or mes core language.
Use only a fixed set of identifiers, say those in the core language, say mes.
We can use the bootstrap code.
Profile the execution of the compilation, capture the functions.
Tokenize the language.
Generate statements from the grammar.
Generate invalid/valid statements.
Look at the distribution of the encoding.

Reduce the token count to only the needed ones.
Autoencode the embedding, reduce the size.
Autoencode the first layer, reduce the size.

Finally we can then create a symbolic regression of the embedding and the first layer that will capture the core language.
